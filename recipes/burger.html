    <p><h4>Description</h4></p>
    <p>To make a tasty homemade hamburger, start by shaping 500g of ground beef into four equal patties, seasoning each with salt and pepper. Preheat your grill or frying pan over medium-high heat and cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired doneness. During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty to melt. Meanwhile, toast four hamburger buns until golden. Assemble your burgers by placing a patty on the bottom bun, then adding your favorite toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, and mustard. Place the top bun on and enjoy your delicious homemade hamburger!</p>
